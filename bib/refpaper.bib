abstract = {In real world scenarios, measurements from a robot's environment and their respective models are rarely homogeneous in terms of their uncertainty. Instead it is likely to have classes of objects that greatly differ in this respect, such as static and dynamic, unique and ambiguous or previously known and previously unknown objects. This paper extends the concept of FastSLAM to exploit this fact in order to more efficiently localize an autonomous mobile robot and simultaneously map features and track dynamic objects in its environment in a cooperative multi-robot scenario.},

@article{Gohring2009,
abstract = {In this paper we present a novel approach using constraint based techniques for world modeling, i.e. self localization and object modeling. Within the last years, we have seen a reduction of landmarks such as beacons or colored goals within the RoboCup domain. Using other features as line information becomes more important. Using such sensor data is tricky, especially when the resulting position belief is stretched over a larger area. Constraints can overcome this limitations, as they have several advantages: they can represent large distributions and are easy to store and to communicate to other robots. Propagation of several constraints can be computationally cheap. Even high dimensional belief functions can be used. We will describe a sample implementation and show experimental results.},

@article{Merwe2004,
abstract = {Core to integrated navigation systems is the concept of fusing noisy observations from GPS, Inertial Measurement Units (IMU), and other available sensors. The current industry standard and most widely used algorithm for this purpose is the extended Kalman filter (EKF) 6. The EKF combines the sensor measurements with predictions coming from a model of vehicle motion (either dynamic or kinematic), in order to generate an estimate of the current navigational state (position, velocity, and attitude). This paper points out the inherent shortcomings in using the EKF and presents, as an alternative, a family of improved derivativeless nonlinear Kalman filters called sigma-point Kalman filters (SPKF). We demonstrate the improved state estimation performance of the SPKF by applying it to the problem of loosely coupled GPS/INS integration. A novel method to account for latency in the GPS updates is also developed for the SPKF (such latency compensation is typically inaccurate or not practical with the EKF). A UAV (rotor-craft) test platform is used to demonstrate the results. Performance metrics indicate an approximate 30\% error reduction in both attitude and position estimates relative to the baseline EKF implementation.},

@article{Riedmiller1993,
abstract = {A learning algorithm for multilayer feedforward networks, RPROP
(resilient propagation), is proposed. To overcome the inherent
disadvantages of pure gradient-descent, RPROP performs a local
adaptation of the weight-updates according to the behavior of the error
function. Contrary to other adaptive techniques, the effect of the RPROP
adaptation process is not blurred by the unforeseeable influence of the
size of the derivative, but only dependent on the temporal behavior of
its sign. This leads to an efficient and transparent adaptation process.
The capabilities of RPROP are shown in comparison to other adaptive
techniques},

This paper evaluates these different choices with respect to their influence on the systemâ€™s estimation quality and points out simple yet effective solutions. Camera-based localization for a humanoid robot is chosen as an example application and the localiza- tion benefit of different approaches is evaluated using real and simulated feature perceptions.},

@article{Wan2000,
abstract = {This paper points out the flaws in using the extended Kalman filter (EKE) and introduces an improvement, the unscented Kalman filter (UKF), proposed by Julier and Uhlman (1997). A central and vital operation performed in the Kalman filter is the propagation of a Gaussian random variable (GRV) through the system dynamics. In the EKF the state distribution is approximated by a GRV, which is then propagated analytically through the first-order linearization of the nonlinear system. This can introduce large errors in the true posterior mean and covariance of the transformed GRV, which may lead to sub-optimal performance and sometimes divergence of the filter. The UKF addresses this problem by using a deterministic sampling approach. The state distribution is again approximated by a GRV, but is now represented using a minimal set of carefully chosen sample points. These sample points completely capture the true mean and covariance of the GRV, and when propagated through the true nonlinear system, captures the posterior mean and covariance accurately to the 3rd order (Taylor series expansion) for any nonlinearity. The EKF in contrast, only achieves first-order accuracy. Remarkably, the computational complexity of the UKF is the same order as that of the EKF. Julier and Uhlman demonstrated the substantial performance gains of the UKF in the context of state-estimation for nonlinear control. Machine learning problems were not considered. We extend the use of the UKF to a broader class of nonlinear estimation problems, including nonlinear system identification, training of neural networks, and dual estimation problems. In this paper, the algorithms are further developed and illustrated with a number of additional examples},

@article{Bentley1975,
abstract = {This paper develops the multidimensional binary search tree (or k-d tree, where k is the dimensionality of the search space) as a data structure for storage of information to be retrieved by associative searches. The k-d tree is defined and examples are given. It is shown to be quite efficient in its storage requirements. A significant advantage of this structure is that a single data structure can handle many types of queries very efficiently. Various utility algorithms are developed; their proven average running times in an n record file are: insertion, O(log n); deletion of the root, O(n(k-1)/k); deletion of a random node, O(log n); and optimization (guarantees logarithmic performance of searches), O(n log n). Search algorithms are given for partial match queries with t keys specified [proven maximum running time of O(n(k-t)/k)] and for nearest neighbor queries [empirically observed average running time of O(log n).] These performances far surpass the best currently known algorithms for these tasks. An algorithm is presented to handle any general intersection query. The main focus of this paper is theoretical. It is felt, however, that k-d trees could be quite useful in many applications, and examples of potential uses are given.},
