abstract = {Core to integrated navigation systems is the concept of fusing noisy observations from GPS, Inertial Measurement Units (IMU), and other available sensors. The current industry standard and most widely used algorithm for this purpose is the extended Kalman filter (EKF) 6. The EKF combines the sensor measurements with predictions coming from a model of vehicle motion (either dynamic or kinematic), in order to generate an estimate of the current navigational state (position, velocity, and attitude). This paper points out the inherent shortcomings in using the EKF and presents, as an alternative, a family of improved derivativeless nonlinear Kalman filters called sigma-point Kalman filters (SPKF). We demonstrate the improved state estimation performance of the SPKF by applying it to the problem of loosely coupled GPS/INS integration. A novel method to account for latency in the GPS updates is also developed for the SPKF (such latency compensation is typically inaccurate or not practical with the EKF). A UAV (rotor-craft) test platform is used to demonstrate the results. Performance metrics indicate an approximate 30\% error reduction in both attitude and position estimates relative to the baseline EKF implementation.},

abstract = {The development of estimation systems based on Kalman fil- ters requires several design choices. Among others, these are the methods used for linearization, coordinate systems for measurement representa- tions, and approximations such as how to handle multiple simultaneous observations per time step. This paper evaluates these different choices with respect to their influence on the systemâ€™s estimation quality and points out simple yet effective solutions. Camera-based localization for a humanoid robot is chosen as an example application and the localiza- tion benefit of different approaches is evaluated using real and simulated feature perceptions.},

abstract = {In real world scenarios, measurements from a robot's environment and their respective models are rarely homogeneous in terms of their uncertainty. Instead it is likely to have classes of objects that greatly differ in this respect, such as static and dynamic, unique and ambiguous or previously known and previously unknown objects. This paper extends the concept of FastSLAM to exploit this fact in order to more efficiently localize an autonomous mobile robot and simultaneously map features and track dynamic objects in its environment in a cooperative multi-robot scenario.},

@article{Gohring2009,
abstract = {In this paper we present a novel approach using constraint based techniques for world modeling, i.e. self localization and object modeling. Within the last years, we have seen a reduction of landmarks such as beacons or colored goals within the RoboCup domain. Using other features as line information becomes more important. Using such sensor data is tricky, especially when the resulting position belief is stretched over a larger area. Constraints can overcome this limitations, as they have several advantages: they can represent large distributions and are easy to store and to communicate to other robots. Propagation of several constraints can be computationally cheap. Even high dimensional belief functions can be used. We will describe a sample implementation and show experimental results.},

The approach is characterized by high precision, robustness and computational efficiency.},
