\section{Speed Profiles of Localization Algorithms}\label{sec:profiles}
The following program profiles are the total time (seconds) for executing the perception log file refered in \autoref{sec:Benchmark} with repect to each localization algorithm. For the purpose of benchmark, the execution of the log is performed on a NAO V4 robot without other CPU intensive modules running. The total execution time is indicated at the top left corner of the profile. Each box inside the profile is the function which is invoked by the localization algorithm, and the size of the box corresponds to the occupation of execution time.
